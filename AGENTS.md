# CodexPro Automation Repository Rules

## GPT Automation Change Persistence

- Any durable change to GPT or ChatGPT skills, CodexPro/agbrowse bridges, browser runners, prompt or mode routing, recovery, state, locks, tabs, app registration, Web Multi-GPT, or their tests must include focused verification and a descriptive Git commit before the work is reported complete.
- The installed files under `%USERPROFILE%\.codex` are deployment copies, not the sole source of truth. Synchronize reusable fixes back into this repository instead of leaving them only in the global installation.
- Public-safe reusable changes must be committed to the clean public `main`, pushed, and checked in CI. Never copy credentials, host-only values, sensitive artifacts, or private Git history into this repository.
- Never push a private-history development branch to the public repository. If commit, push, or CI verification is blocked, report the exact dirty files and blocker and do not claim completion.
